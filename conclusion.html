        <p>It is worth mentioning at this point that the aim of this study
which is the design and implementation of a smart walking
stick for the blind has been fully achieved. The Smart Stick
acts as a basic platform for the coming generation of more
aiding devices to help the visually impaired to navigate safely
both indoor and outdoor. It is effective and affordable. It leads
to good results in detecting the obstacles on the path of the
user in a range of three meters. This system offers a low-cost,
reliable, portable, low power consumption and robust solution
for navigation with obvious short response time. Though the
system is hard-wired with sensors and other components, it's
light in weight. Further aspects of this system can be improved
via wireless connectivity between the system components,
thus, increasing the range of the ultrasonic sensor and
implementing a technology for determining the speed of
approaching obstacles. While developing such an empowering
solution, visually impaired and blind people in all developing
countries were on top of our priorities.<b></b> The device constructed
in this work is only capable of detecting obstacles and
moisture. Holes cannot be detected using this device nor the
nature of obstacle. Therefore, a better device can be
constructed using ultrasonic sensors, arduino Uno and other
devices that employ audio commands to alert the user of what
is in his path of movement. A vibrator may also be added for
ease of use and convenience. In the future, further
modifications to enhance the performance of the system will
be added. These include: A global positioning method to find
the position of' the user using the GPS, and GSM modules to
communicate the location to a relative or care giver. It should
also accommodate wide varying grips for flexible handling.
