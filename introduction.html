                <p>    Visually impaired people are the people who finds it difficult to recognize the smallest detail with healthy eyes. Those who have the visual acuteness of 6/60 or the horizontal range of the visual field with both eyes open have less than or equal to 20 degrees. These people are regarded as blind. A survey by WHO (World Health Organization) carried out in 2011 estimates that in the world, about 1% of the human population is visually impaired (about 70 million people) and amongst them, about 10% are fully blind (about 7 million people) and 90% (about 63 million people) with low vision. The main problem with blind people is how to navigate their way to wherever they want to go. Such people need assistance from others with good eyesight. As described by WHO, 10% of the visually impaired have no functional eyesight at all to help them move around without assistance and safely. <b></b>This study proposes a new technique for designing a smart stick to help visually impaired people that will provide them navigation. The conventional and archaic navigation aids for persons with visual impairments are the walking cane (also called white cane or stick) and guide dogs which are characterized by a many imperfections. <br>    The most critical shortcomings of these aids include: essential skills and training phase, range of motion, and very insignificant information communicated been communicated. Our approach modified this cane with some electronics components and sensors, the electronic aiding devices are designed to solve such issues. The ultrasonic sensors, water sensor, buzzer, and RF transmitter/Receiver are used to record information about the presence of obstacles on the road. Ultrasonic sensor have the capacity to detect any obstacle within the distance range of 2cm-450cm. Therefore whenever there is an obstacle in this range it will alert the user. Water
sensor is used to detect if there is water in path of the user. Most blind guidance systems use ultrasound because of its immunity to the environmental noise. With the rapid advances of modern technology both in hardware and software it has become easier to provide intelligent navigation system to the visually impaired. Recently, much research effort have been focused on the design of Electronic Travel Aids (ETA) to aid the successful and free navigation of the blind. Also, high-end technological solutions have been introduced recently to help blind persons navigate independently. Another reason why ultrasonic is prevalent is that the technology is reasonably cheap. Moreover, ultrasound emitters and detectors are portable components that can be carried without the need for complex circuit. RF module will help the person to find the stick wherever it is placed.
